Below is a comprehensive list of functional and non‑functional requirements for the Bitcoin ETF Analytics & Strategy Platform, organized by feature. You can use this as a requirements document or as a checklist to ensure your application delivers valuable insights from an investor’s perspective.

1. Correlation Analysis

Functional Requirements:
	•	Data Aggregation:
	•	Integrate API feeds for on‑chain metrics (transaction volume, active addresses, miner revenue, etc.) from providers like Glassnode or CryptoQuant.
	•	Pull ETF data (net inflows/outflows, price, trading volume, etc.) from financial data APIs (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage) and SEC EDGAR filings if possible.
	•	Correlation Computation:
	•	Calculate correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson, Spearman) between on‑chain data metrics and ETF metrics.
	•	Provide options to analyze different time windows (daily, weekly, monthly) and display correlation charts.
	•	Visualization:
	•	Generate interactive charts (scatter plots, line charts) that overlay on‑chain data with ETF metrics.
	•	Enable filtering by ETF ticker, time range, and specific on‑chain metrics.

Non‑Functional Requirements:
	•	Data must be updated in near real‑time (or on a scheduled interval, e.g., every 15 minutes).
	•	Ensure responsiveness for interactive charting (consider using libraries like D3.js or Chart.js).

2. Tracking Error & Performance Metrics

Functional Requirements:
	•	Historical Data Analysis:
	•	Store historical ETF price data and underlying Bitcoin price data for performance comparison.
	•	Tracking Error Calculation:
	•	Compute tracking error over selected periods (e.g., 1 month, 3 months, 1 year) between ETF performance and the underlying asset.
	•	Provide performance metrics such as volatility, standard deviation, and cumulative return for both datasets.
	•	Reporting:
	•	Display charts and summary statistics (tracking error percentage, average return differences) in an easy-to-read format.
	•	Allow users to select custom time ranges.

Non‑Functional Requirements:
	•	Ensure computations are efficient for historical datasets.
	•	Data visualizations should be clear, with options to export reports (PDF, CSV).

3. Liquidity & Trading Volume Insights

Functional Requirements:
	•	Real-Time Data:
	•	Fetch ETF trading volume, bid–ask spreads, and liquidity metrics using APIs (e.g., from Bloomberg, FactSet, or free APIs like Alpha Vantage).
	•	Aggregate on‑chain transaction volumes and compare these with ETF trading volumes.
	•	Dashboards:
	•	Create dashboards that show current liquidity metrics, historical trends, and real‑time alerts if liquidity falls below a threshold.
	•	Comparison Tools:
	•	Provide side-by-side charts comparing ETF liquidity metrics with on‑chain activity.

Non‑Functional Requirements:
	•	Ensure data refresh rates are sufficiently fast for real‑time trading insights (e.g., update every minute during trading hours).
	•	Maintain high accuracy and low latency in data retrieval.

4. Risk Metrics and Alerts

Functional Requirements:
	•	Risk Calculation Modules:
	•	Implement calculations for risk metrics such as Value-at-Risk (VaR), standard deviation, and beta for both ETF and underlying asset.
	•	Offer simulation tools to model risk under different scenarios (e.g., extreme volatility events).
	•	Alert System:
	•	Allow users to set custom alerts for conditions such as sudden drops/increases in ETF inflows, spikes in on‑chain activity, or abnormal volatility levels.
	•	Send notifications via email and/or SMS when thresholds are crossed.
	•	User Interface:
	•	Provide a configuration panel for users to set their risk thresholds and alert preferences.

Non‑Functional Requirements:
	•	Ensure alerts trigger in real‑time with minimal delay.
	•	Provide a secure and user-friendly configuration experience.

5. Fee and Expense Analysis

Functional Requirements:
	•	Data Integration:
	•	Aggregate fee and expense data for each Bitcoin ETF from financial data APIs and ETF provider disclosures.
	•	Impact Calculator:
	•	Build a tool that simulates how different fee levels affect long-term returns, incorporating compound interest calculations.
	•	Visualization:
	•	Provide side-by-side comparisons of expense ratios for different ETFs with visual graphs/charts.
	•	Allow historical fee trends analysis.

Non‑Functional Requirements:
	•	Ensure the calculator is accurate and easy to update as fees change.
	•	The UI should clearly communicate the impact of fees with intuitive graphs.

6. Regulatory & Market Sentiment Indicators

Functional Requirements:
	•	News Feed Integration:
	•	Integrate with news APIs (e.g., NewsAPI, Financial Times RSS feeds) to pull relevant headlines about Bitcoin ETFs and regulatory updates.
	•	Include sentiment analysis on news headlines or social media feeds using a natural language processing API (e.g., Google Cloud Natural Language, IBM Watson).
	•	Dashboard Widgets:
	•	Create widgets showing sentiment scores, recent regulatory decisions, and key announcements that could impact ETF performance.
	•	Filter & Tag:
	•	Enable users to filter news by topic (e.g., SEC, ETF performance, on-chain developments) and see historical sentiment trends.

Non‑Functional Requirements:
	•	Ensure news data is updated frequently (at least hourly) to capture fast-moving regulatory changes.
	•	Provide a clean, unobtrusive UI element for sentiment visualization.

7. Comparative Analytics

Functional Requirements:
	•	ETF Comparison Tool:
	•	Allow users to compare multiple ETFs side by side, showing key metrics like expense ratios, net inflows/outflows, historical returns, liquidity metrics, and tracking error.
	•	Custom Views:
	•	Offer filter options to compare spot vs. futures-based ETFs.
	•	Generate dynamic comparison charts and tables.
	•	Benchmarking:
	•	Include benchmarks (e.g., S&P 500, gold ETFs) for broader market context.

Non‑Functional Requirements:
	•	Ensure data is normalized so comparisons are meaningful.
	•	The tool should be responsive and allow exporting of comparison reports.

8. Portfolio Diversification Tools

	•	Scenario Analysis:
	•	Provide tools to run “what-if” scenarios showing how changes in ETF exposure affect overall portfolio risk and return.
	•	Visualization & Reporting:
	•	Use interactive charts (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs, risk-return scatter plots) to demonstrate diversification benefits.
	•	Offer rebalancing recommendations based on risk profiles and market conditions.

Non‑Functional Requirements:
	•	The simulator must provide real-time or near real‑time feedback.
	•	Ensure the tool is intuitive and visually engaging for non‑technical users.

General Technical & Non‑Functional Requirements
	•	Scalability & Performance:
	•	Design the backend to handle multiple API calls and data aggregation efficiently.
